      <h2>MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT</h1>
      <p>Mechanical Engineering is a highly versatile and diversified engineering discipline. The department offers four years degree program leading to BSc in Mechanical Engineering. At present, around 750 students in BSc, 65 students in MSc and 35 students in PhD are enrolled in the program. So far 37 students have successfully completed their Doctorate Degrees. The undergraduate mechanical engineering program is designed to inculcate a comprehensive understanding of theory and practice related to applied mechanics, thermo fluids, and manufacturing. It is a unique blend of engineering sciences with well-balanced laboratory work, design project, and manufacturing processes, with extensive usage of computers and latest software packages.

        The department has well-equipped laboratories to meet the academic requirements of students and teachers as well as the professional needs of the government and private organizations. The department has CNC machining centres in the Machine Tools Laboratory. Fracture Mechanics & Fatigue laboratory is established in the extension block of Mechanical Engineering Department. The idea to establish this advance laboratory was to enhance the research and development activities in the field of fatigue and fracture. The laboratory is equipped with many state of the art highly precise testing equipment along with related specimen preparation facility. This laboratory is potentially able to produce internationally scaled research work in the field of fracture mechanics, fatigue of engineering materials and structures and failure analysis of engineering components and related equipment’s. Recently Department Has Enhanced Lab research facility by adding Scanning Electron Microscope and Vacuum Coating Machine...</p>

      <h2>Department of Industrial Engineering</h1>
      <p>The master program was launched in 1991, followed by BSc in 2010 and PhD in 2013. Industrial Engineering department at UET Taxila has world renowned faculty. Currently there are PhD doctors and M. Sc faculty members (purely in industrial engineering) with expertise in the field of manufacturing processes and materials engineering, manufacturing systems design, optimization of industrial resources, simulation of processes, agile and lean manufacturing, lean product design and development, cost estimation, quality management, automation and robotics, industrial automation, strategic and knowledge management. In industrial Engineering, students are offered two tracks for specialization which includes Manufacturing, and Management. On the core technology side, B. Sc in Industrial Engineering offers students a unique opportunity to learn classical production technologies in courses like Workshop Technology, Manufacturing Processes, Metal forming and cutting analysis, Metrology and Tool Engineering. The high-tech courses embed in students the capabilities to learn and acquire modern production systems in courses like CAD/CAM, Robotics, Automation and Computer Integrated Manufacturing.

        Soft technologies encompassing Statistical Analysis, Economics Optimization and Simulation Modeling courses prepare students to design and build large and complex systems for efficiency and effectiveness. Also, strong emphasis has been ensured to inculcate managerial capabilities in industrial engineering students by including a host of courses in management electives. Rich industrial neighborhood around the University offers prospective industrial engineering students an ideal environment to groom their professional skills. These industries include Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC), Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT), Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF), KSB Pumps, Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP), Pakistan Air Force (PAF) complex at KAMRA, BESTWAY cement and a host of SME’s in nearby Hattar Industrial Estate.....</p>
